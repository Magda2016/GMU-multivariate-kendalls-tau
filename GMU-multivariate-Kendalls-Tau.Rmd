### Assumption

For simplicity we are assuming that the points are generated from continous distribution. In other words 
we are assuming that there is not ties in any given dimension for all random vectors in data set.

### Quarter Indexing 

Lets assume that we have a one dimensional space. Graphically we can represent it as a line with defined 0.
We have two halves and we can use binary system to indicate each half. Positive numbers are indicated by 1 and
negative numbers are indicated by 0. 

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binary-one-dimension.png")
```

When we increease number of dimensions by one we have a plane devided into four quarters and we need two binary 
numbers to index all quarters. 

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binary-two-dimension.png")
```

In the case of three dimensional space we have eight "quarters" and we can index all quarters with three binary numbers.

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binary-three-dimension.png")
```

The rule for indexing quarter is rather obvious. First we observe that the number of "Quarters" is equal to $2^d$, where
d represents number of dimenstions. For each of the dimesions the value can be either bigger or smaller than zero (for 
now we will ingore case when value is 0). Therefore we need one bit per each dimension to index position of the point in
$d$ dimensial space. It is worth to notice that the index starts from 0 and ends at $2^d-1$

Furthermore it is important to notice that for each "quarter" there is an oposite quarter where all bits are negated.

R = matrix(cbind(1.000000, 0.1121, 0.851929,  
                 0.112100, 1.0000, 0.140000,  
                 0.851929, 0.1400, 1.000000),

  return(res)
}

for(i in 1:numobs) {
  qrtVec = rep(0, 7)
  for(k in 1:numobs) {
    if (i != k) {
      p =  newX[k,1:3] - newX[i,1:3]
      if (sum(as.integer(p == 0)) == 0) {
        p = as.integer(p < 0)
        p = bintodec(p)
        qrtVec[p] = 1
      }
